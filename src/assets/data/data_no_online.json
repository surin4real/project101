  "t_desc": "Visiting Bangkok is not complete without visiting the world famous Damnoen Saduak Floating Market. This half-day tour will start when our team collects you from your hotel in Bangkok for an early start for the trip to this colourful market located about one hour from the city. An early start is necessary as this is a morning market and we want to catch all the colourful boats and the hustle and bustle. On the way to Damnoen Saduak, we will make a stop at Mae Klong Train Market. Here, you will witness market vendors set up their produce directly across the tracks of a functioning railway line. Wait and watch in amazement as an extraordinary scene unfolds when the passenger train rides through this market! Before reaching Damnoen Saduak, we will stop for a short visit at a wonderful little Home industry that produces delicious palm sugar. You will get to see how this sugar being produced and also try some of the delectable candy made from the palm sugar. Upon your arrival at Damnoen Saduak, you will step aboard a privately chartered long tail motorboat on which you will travel through narrow canals leading to the floating market and you will witness the life on this charming waterway. Once at the market, you will disembark the motorboat and will be free to walk through the market; wander up and down the areas surrounding the canals flagging down vendors on their boats loaded with produce. You can even take the paddleboat option to get amongst the bustling action on the canals. Once our floating market visit over, we will board the awaiting transportation and return to Bangkok. This tour will finish when we escort you back to your hotel. Optional on this tour is also an elephant ride; you may opt for this as we return to Bangkok.",

  "t_desc": "This tour will begin when we collect you from your Bangkok hotel for your early start to this colourful market. An early start is essential as the drive to Damnoen Saduak is a little over one hour and we do not want to miss the colourful boats of this morning market. On the route to Damnoen Saduak we will stop by at Mae Klong Train Market where you witness the market vendors goods set up across the tracks of a working railway line. Just wait and see the amazing scene unfold when the scheduled train passes through this market! Before Damnoen Saduak we will make a short stop at a wonderful little Home industry producing palm sugar. You can see the sugar being made as well as try some of the sweet candy produced from the palm sugar. At Damnoen Saduak you well board a privately chartered motorboat where we will travel some of the canals on the way to the market and you can get a glimpse of real canal side life. we will disembark the boat at the market and you will then be free to explore the market, you can wander up and down the canals flagging down boats and vendors as you please or take the paddle boat option where you can really get amongst the action on the canals. Following the market we will make our way back to Bangkok. On route if you want to ride an elephant then just let you guide know as we will be happy to stop for you at the elephant camp for a half hour ride. On arrive in Bangkok will have lunch before you can choose to visit Wat Po OR visit Bangkok's most important Palace and temple complex. If you visit Wat Po you will get to see a plethora of Buddha statues, temple buildings and Wat Po's highlight which is the giant reclining Buddha. For those who visit the The Grand Palace (extra charge applies), the Grand Palace was built as a Royal residence and over the years many additions have been made including the stunning Wat Prah Kaew which houses the Emerald Buddha carved out of a single piece of Jade! The last stop of the day will be Wat Arun one of Bangkok's most iconic temples. You will be able to get close up and climb part way up the Pagoda to get a panoramic view over the Chao Phraya. At the end of the day we will transfer you back to your Bangkok hotel.Clarification: In the above programme you can choose to visit Wat Po OR The Grand Palace. Unfortunatley there is not enough time to visit both. Entrance fee to Wat Po is included in the tour price below. If you want to take the Grand Palace option then we ask you to pay 400 baht/person to cover the extra cost of the Grand Palace ticket entrance.Important Update - Sept 2013: Due to a train timetable change it is unlikely that you will get to see the train passing through The Mae Klong Train Market on this tour. The train has been put back to a later time and now clashes with a visit to the floating market (For now we are leaving a visit to the market in the itinerary as the market itself is still of interest) If the timetable does not return to its previous times we will be moving the train from this tour description. Sorry for any disappointment.Important: Please read Grand Palace Dress Code below",
