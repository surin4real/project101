For air and hotel package transactions, the rates displayed on the Site are a combination of either: (i) the varying net airfare and room rate that Glotourthailand.com and/or its partners has pre-negotiated with airline and hotel suppliers plus the varying mark-up of the net rate(s) that Glotourthailand.com and/or its partners retain as compensation for their services; OR (ii) the varying bundled net air and hotel package rate that is received from airline and hotel package suppliers plus the varying mark-up of the net rate(s) that Glotourthailand.com and/or its partners retain as compensation for their services.
</p><p>
The taxes and fees displayed for non-packaged hotel transactions and bundled air and hotel packages are a combination of: (i) tax recovery charges that are remitted directly to the suppliers (see below for a full explanation); and (ii) varying service fees that include the hard costs that are incurred in the processing of your transaction as well as compensation for Glotourthailand.com's and/or its partners’ services.
</p><p>
The tax charge on hotel transactions and air and hotel transactions is a recovery of all applicable transaction taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, and other similar taxes) that are paid to the vendors (e.g. hotels, airlines, etc.) in connection with your travel reservations. Glotourthailand.com and/or its partners are not remitting said tax to the applicable tax authorities. The suppliers bill all applicable taxes to Glotourthailand.com and/or its partners and we remit such taxes directly to the supplier. Glotourthailand.com and/or its partners are not co-vendors associated with the supplier with whom travel arrangements are booked. The actual tax cost paid to the supplier may vary from the tax recovery charge, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of actual use by you.
</p><p>
Hotel taxes are applied to the net room rate that is paid to the supplier for the hotel room. The service fee charged for hotel transactions and air and hotel transactions is a varying percentage that is applied to the sum of the item subtotal plus taxes.
